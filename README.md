# Vue Template Project

This repo provides a simple springboard for building apps with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS without any of the boilerplate components, views, and styles you get when using `create-vue`. 

## Project Assumptions
- Vue 3 (using JS not TS)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint, Prettier, and VS Code

## How to use this repo

The recommended way to use this repo is with NPM package `create-using`:

- From a prompt, run `npm init using kevinmlong/vue3-starter.git <path-to-project-directory>` where `<path-to-project-directory>` could be something like `my-project`
- Go into the project directory and run `npm install`
- Once dependencies have been installed, run `npm run dev`
- The app should now be available at http://localhost:3000 or whatever port Vite found was available
